## How to Hack an Agent – or Not

### Talk
Large language models (LLMs) are not as secure as they seem. Beyond their tendency to “hallucinate,” they can be manipulated using jailbreaks and adversarial prompts, bypassing safeguards designed to keep them in check. But the real challenge arises when LLMs are connected to agents with real-world capabilities—like sending emails. This talk explores the security risks of AI agents and the ongoing research into making them more resilient. Using the "Adaptive Prompt Injection: LLMail Inject" challenge from the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning as a case study, we’ll examine how Microsoft’s Phi3 and OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini handle adversarial attacks. We’ll break down security techniques like LLM judges, task drift detection, and prompt shields—critical concepts as the EU AI Act's security mandates take effect in August 2025. Attendees will gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current AI security mechanisms and learn practical strategies for assessing the safety of AI agents in production environments.

### About
Thomas is an MLOps and NLP expert with a background in applied mathematics and embedded programming. He has led two publicly funded AI research programs with the German Aerospace Center and is currently focused on AI-driven cybersecurity at Smart Labs AI GmbH. In his spare time, he’s developing a low-budget drone system for detecting bark beetle infestations, blending his passion for AI and embedded systems.
